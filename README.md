# hello-world

ISO/IEC 42010:2007 defines "architecture" as:

    "The fundamental organization of a system, embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution."
    
Given this definition I feel myself part of the architect community since I'm focused on devising solution starting from a business value. I intend the architecture as the discipline that solves the business needs relying on tecnology, process and people.
